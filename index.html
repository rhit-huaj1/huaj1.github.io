    <p>As a freshman at Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology, I'm diving deep into the realms of computer science and software engineering, fields that spark not just my curiosity but my passion. My fascination with computers isn't confined to the classroom; it extends into my personal life, where I've found joy and challenge in building PCs. Not just for myself, but also for my friends, turning what started as a hobby into a skill I'm proud of. This passion for technology is matched by my commitment to staying active and social. I make it a point to hit the gym regularly, ensuring that I keep my body as fit as my mind. Balancing academic pursuits with physical well-being, I also cherish the moments spent hanging out with friends, believing that a well-rounded life fuels both creativity and innovation.</p>
    <p>Looking ahead, I'm driven by a vision to reshape the music technology landscape. Observing how pervasive autotune has become, often at the expense of an artist's unique voice, I aspire to develop personalized music software. This isn't just about adjusting pitches but preserving the distinctiveness that makes each voice special. I envision a platform that can enhance musical expression without sacrificing authenticity, aiming to bring artists' true sounds to the forefront. This dream is a synthesis of my love for technology, creativity, and a desire to make a lasting impact in the world of music, ensuring artists can be heard as they truly are, in all their unfiltered glory.</p>
