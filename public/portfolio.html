        <p>Artificial intelligence (AI) and autotuning have become ubiquitous in the music industry, but they often come at the expense of the artist's unique voice and integrity. As an aspiring technologist and musician, I'm passionate about addressing this issue.</p>
        <p>In my future projects, I aim to develop software solutions that preserve the authenticity and individuality of artists' voices while leveraging technology to enhance musical expression.</p>
